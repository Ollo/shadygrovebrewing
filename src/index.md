## Welcome to Shady Grove Brewing Company

<section class='intro'>
<img src='./images/profile.jpg' class='profile'/> My name is Joshua Ray and this is my personal home brewing blog.
I'm a bit of a beer nerd and recently started homebrewing on a 5 gallon stainless steel all grain single infusion mash system from SsBrewtech in my garage. This site is an attempt to catalog all of my choices and experiments in building a brewing system, designing recipes and choosing and growing my own ingredients. I hope you find some of my experiments and learnings useful. Cheers üç∫
