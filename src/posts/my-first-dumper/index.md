So after my first initial batch I bought some wire racks from home depot and more formally set up my  
equipment as a gravity system. I also purchased a small anvil pump to help with moving liquid up the gravity
system and struck out to do another brew but with a friend or two this time to help. 

A friend and far more experienced homebrewer recommended that after the confusion and mixed results in my first 
batch I simplify my recipe design and do a SMaSH ale so I can focus on process and lower the number of variables.
