## Shady Malle

So I had bought the 5 gallon system, had gone to boulder fermentation supply and bumbled through finding a recipe and ingredients with the help of a shop regular and now it was time to embark on my first solo brew day.

I picked up a wire rack from Lowes and snagged an Ikea desk that wasn't being used and tried to set up a basic gravity system. I unpacked, assembled and cleaned all my equipment with the PBW I had also purchased after visiting the homebrew shop and tried to plan a path into the unknown on a new system with only the internet and memories of what I had seen other brewers do in the past as an observer / assistant. My first recipe was photos on my phone of a West Malle recipe from a magazine I was referred to at the shop and my process was me taking a shot at following the getting started guide from the 5 gallon SsBrewtech kit which outlined some basics. I was so excited to finally brew so I dived in ready or not. 

It was stressful...

In the end I managed to produce about 3 gallons of beer which I kegged and served to my family when I hosted Thanksgiving. I also brought a growler to some friends to sample, everyone enjoyed it and had good things to say about the flavor and authenticity of the style. 

Some stats from the brew day:
