## There is a Time
Biere de Garde translates as “beer for keeping.”  This less common blonde variant and has a bit more hop presence than its amber and brown siblings and despite the name is lovely fresh. 

I especially love this song as played by the Dillards who cameoed regularly on the Andy Griffith show as the Darlings.
